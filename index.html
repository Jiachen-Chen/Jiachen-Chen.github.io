                    <p class="publications continue2">In this project, we address 4 issues with existing Mission-Critical Push-to-talk (MCPTT) systems:</p>
                    <ul class="publications continue">
                        <li><strong>The messages cannot be stored or re-played.</strong> When the receiver could not hear it clearly,
                            he/she has to ask the sender to repeat. This wastes not only the channel resource but also the precious
                            time
                            of the first responders.
                        </li>
                        <li>When a first responder needs to focus on some work and come back to the communication later, he/she
                            <strong>cannot pause the messages and play them when he/she is ready to hear.</strong></li>
                        <li>It is <strong>difficult to serialize speech</strong>, especially on the connection with long delay,
                            e.g.,
                            satellite. The first responders would end up wasting a lot of time waiting for the floor or just
                            overtalk each other.
                        </li>
                        <li>Existing solutions <strong>lack support for intermittently-connected and infrastructure-less
                            environments</strong>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="publications continue2">To address these issues, we consolidate the existing
                        <a href="https://www.mcopenplatform.org/" target="_blank">Mission Critical Open Platform (MCOP)</a>
                        with our enhancements:</p>
                    <ul class="publications continue">
                        <li>Our application <strong>stores messages</strong> received from the platform and <strong>play them when
                            the user wants</strong>. This includes <strong>message replay</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>We allow users to <strong>push and talk whenever they want to</strong>. The application will monitor the
                            availability of the channel and send the messages when it can acquire the floor.
                        </li>
                        <li>We take advantage of cloud-based <strong>speech-to-text</strong> and <strong>text-to-speech</strong>
                            capabilities to accelerate communication.
                        </li>
                        <li>We added <strong>store-and-forward</strong> and <strong>device-to-device (D2D) communication</strong>
                            capabilities to support for different scenarios, including

                        ReDiCom seeks to build a resilient architecture that allows efficient communications among
                        dynamically formed groups of first responder teams even when there is damage to infrastructure.
                        The architecture includes the following components:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="publications continue">
                        <li><strong>A dynamic naming schema</strong>
                            allowing the first responders to address each other via roles instead of the identities of units instantiating the roles.
                            To support efficient and secure communication over the naming schema, we proposed:
                            <ul class="continue2">
                                <li>A protocol supporting effiient <strong>pub/sub over graph-based namespace</strong>.
                                We realized that supporting the graph logic directly in the network layer incurs too much overhead.
                                To address this issue, we introduced an <strong>information layer</strong> that resides only on some nodes in the network to deal with the rich semantics,
                                while the other nodes perform flat name lookups for efficient forwarding.</li>
                                <li>A <strong>namespace synchronization</strong> protocol that helps deliver namespace updates efficiently even in the disconnected environments. </li>
                                <li>A semi-automated natural-language processing (NLP) solution that <strong>maps text to corresponding names</strong> so that the first responders can send messages to correct receivers even without knowing the namespace.
                                    The solution minimizes the learning effort while keeps high accuracy of the name mapping.</li>
                                <li>A <strong>security</strong> solution using attribute-based encryption (ABE) to ensure the confidentiality and digital signature (with chain of trust) for authenticity.
                                The security minimizes the control overhead on namespace updates to support the use in disconnected environments.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>An efficient binary-state distance-vector routing mechanism</strong> that combines traditional routing and delay-tolerant networking (DTN)
                        for data dissemination in fragmented networks.</li>
                        <li><strong>A coded communication algorithm</strong> that allows the receivers to recover data for each other when the channel is unreliable.
                            The algorithm minimizes the total amount of retransmissions to improve the throughput of the channel.</li>
                        <li><strong>An efficient and secured coded computation mechanism</strong> allowing the first responders to distribute computation-intensive tasks to helpers (including civilians) in a disconnected environment where cloud is not available.
                            The solution uses coding to address the issues of stragglers (slow helpers) and eavesdroppers (helpers that try to infer data from the work).</li>

                        The original MobilityFirst already has an implementation over Click.
                        Yet, that implementation focuses mostly on the functionality rather than the architectural design since the functions are added piece-by-piece in the progress of the
                        <a href="http://mobilityfirst.winlab.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">MF project</a>.
                        When we revisit the implementation at the end of the project,
                        other than the bugs we discovered when working on different applications and in different scenarios,
                        we also found some issues in the architectural design, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="publications continue">
                        <li><strong>No clear boundaries between functions</strong> like encapsulation/decapsulation, segmentation/aggregation and routing.
                            This makes it difficult for new developers to replace a piece of function (e.g., use a new centralized routing like SDN).</li>
                        <li>There are many <strong>data structures</strong> (e.g., chunk table) that are <strong>shared between functions/threads</strong>.
                            This requires locking on these data structures and causing wait when we try to make the implementation multi-threaded.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of parallelism</strong>, the design puts all the incoming packets from different ports
                            into a single incoming queue before processing, causing the implementation difficult to take advantage of
                            multi-core processors that are widely used in servers and software routers nowadays.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>seprated hoststack</strong> implementation repeats many functions already implemented in the click router.
                            The reduced functions also limit the desired capabilities like multi-homing.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>GNRS implementation uses a separate (UDP) channel</strong> instead of MobilityFirst.</li>
                        <li><strong>The implementation is written directly in Click source code</strong>, making it difficult to deploy and update.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other function requirements</strong> like more reliable hop-by-hop transport, a type field needed in GNRS to support services like multicast, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="publications continue2">
                        In this project, we redesign the architecture of the MF implementation, enabling better performance and extensibility for future use.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="publications continue">
                        <li>Firstly, MF2020 is implemented as a <strong>Click module library</strong> that can be compiled and loaded separately. Making it easy to deploy.</li>
                        <li>Then, we look at the different functions in the system and defined several <strong>components that has low coupling</strong> with each other. They include:
                        <ul class="continue2">
                            <li><strong>Encapsulator &amp; Decapsulator</strong> that removes/adds lower-layer headers for incoming/outgoing packets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Topology Manager</strong> that discards packets that should not be received by the router, based on a virtual topology.
                            This is particularly useful for experiments that are executed in a testbed where broadcast messages are sent to every device (e.g., ORBIT).</li>
                            <li><strong>Hop-by-hop Transport</strong> aggregating incoming packets and form <strong>chunks</strong> for other components (e.g., routing) to process, and segmenting outgoing chunks into packets for forwarding.
                                It supports both the reliable and unreliable chunk deliveries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Routing &amp; Replication</strong> that determines the next-hop NA(s) for each chunk based on its destination GUID.</li>
                            <li><strong>GNRS &amp; GNRS Cache</strong> that map GUIDs to destination NAs.
                                With the new design, GNRS will use MF channel naturally.</li>
                            <li><strong>In-network Storage</strong> for delay-tolerant network and in-network caches.</li>
                            <li><strong>Application Interface</strong> that interacts with the residing applications.
                                This design avoids creating yet another hoststack, and allows the end hosts (with applications) also take advantage of the advanced MF routing services.
                                At the same time, the applications can also be the virtual network functions (VNFs) on the MF routers, allowing MF to support NFV naturally.</li>
                        </ul>
                            This design defines the functions and interfaces of each component, and provides a basic implementation.
                            Future developers can choose to replace any component as needed without modifying the other components, as long as they follow the interface requirements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To avoid potential miss-behave between components, we <strong>eliminate all the data structures shared between components</strong>.
                            The components can only communicate via packets or handler calls.
                            This avoids the potential misuse of data structures (or locks) from different components (written by different developers), especially in a multi-threaded implementation.
                        </li>
                        <li>Yet, we <strong>allow elements in a component to share data even when they might be executed in different threads</strong>.
                            The developer of the component should take care of the thread-safety of the shared data structures.
                            We recommend that <strong>read-copy-update (RCU)</strong> strategy can be adopted on the shared data structures especially between the control plane (writer) and the data plane (reader).
                        </li>

                        The rapid growth in IoT deployment has posed unprecedented challenges to the underlying network design.
                        We envision tomorrow's global-scale IoT systems should support global device reach-ability, mobility, diverse communication patterns, and resource efficiency.
                        Existing solutions either rely on IP protocols that do not have efficient mobility support, or seek application-layer optimizations that incur high computing and deployment overhead. </p>
                    <p class="publications continue">
                        To fill this void, we propose to adopt clean-slate network architecture in the core network that decouples locators from network addresses,
                        and towards this end, we propose MF-IoT, which is centered around the MobilityFirst architecture that focuses on mobility handling.
                        MF-IoT enables efficient communication between devices from different local domains, as well as communication between devices and the infrastructure network.
                        The MF-IoT network layer smoothly handles mobility during communication without interrupting the applications.
                        This is achieved through a transparent translation mechanism at the gateway node that bridges an IoT domain and the core network.
                        In the core network, we leverage MobilityFirst functionalities in providing efficient mobility support for billions of mobile devices through long, persistent IDs, while in the local IoT domain, we use short, local IDs for energy efficiency.
                        By seamlessly translating between the two types of IDs, the gateway organically stitches these two parts of the network.</p>
                    <p class="publications continue">
                        To prove the feasibility of the design, we implemented MF-IoT in RIOT and deployed it on a representative IoT test board (Atmel SAM R21 Xplained Pro).
                        Our demo &quot;Motion-Triggered Surveillance Camera using MF-IoT&quot; received best demo award in ACM/IEEE IoTDI'17.</p>
                    <p class="publications continue">
                        Through large scale simulation studies, we show that MF-IoT is able to achieve the four features we envisioned for an IoT system, with performance optimizations in reducing network traffic load, avoiding congestion, and ensuring fast and timely packet delivery.

                        Content retrieval has become the dominant usage of the Internet.
                        To optimize the user experience (in terms of response latency), server load (including DDoS attack prevention), and ISP cost (in terms of inter-domain traffic), third-party Content-Delivery Networks (CDNs) have been deployed in the network,
                        which can be seen as large caches that are placed closer to data consumers.
                        It has been shown that content popularity usually follows a Zipf distribution, and therefore,
                        it is feasible for CDNs to store only a small portion of the content files (compared to all the content files in the network) but achieve a decent cache hit ratio.
                        For example, CDN services provided by AT&T, Akamai, etc., are widely used by the content pro-viders like Facebook YouTube, etc.
                        Some content providers (e.g., Netflix) even build their own CDN ser-vices to further reduce the cost of content (video) delivery.

                        On receiving a query (with a GUID) from the consumer, the MF network would forward it towards the best source (content originator, providers and caches) based on the latency, throughput and policy.

                        With the popularity of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, VR-MMOGs are developing quickly, demanding ever faster gaming interactions and image rendering.
                        In this project, we identify three main <strong>challenges</strong> of VR-MMOGs:</p>
                    <ul class="publications continue2">
                        <li>a stringent <strong>latency</strong> requirement for frequent local view change responses,</li>
                        <li>a high <strong>bandwidth</strong> requirement for constant refreshing, and</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="publications continue">
                        Understanding that a cloud-centric gaming architecture may struggle to deliver the latency/bandwidth requirements, the game development community is attempting to leverage <strong>edge cloud</strong> computing.
                        However, one problem remains unsolved: <strong>how to distribute the work among the user device, the edge clouds, and the center cloud</strong> to meet all three requirements especially when users are mobile.

                    <p class="publications continue">
                        In this project, we design and implement a hybrid gaming architecture that achieves clever work distribution.
                        It places <strong>local view change updates</strong> on edge clouds for immediate responses, frame rendering on edge clouds for high bandwidth, and <strong>global game state updates</strong> on the center cloud for user scalability.

                        In addition, we design an efficient service placement algorithm based on a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
                        This algorithm dynamically places a user's gaming service on edge clouds while the user moves through different access points.
                        It also co-places multiple users to facilitate game world sharing and reduce the overall migration overhead.
                        We derive optimal solutions and devise efficient heuristic approaches.
                        We also study different algorithm implementations to speed up the runtime.
                        Through detailed simulation studies, we validate our placement algorithms and also show that our architecture has the potential to meet all three requirements of VR-MMOGs.

                        Networks are becoming increasingly complex and service providers incorporate additional functionality in the network to protect, manage and improve service performance.
                        Software Defined Networking (SDN) seeks to manage the network with the help of a (logically) centralized control plane.
                        We observe that current SDN solutions pre-translate policy (what) into forwarding rules at specific switches (where).
                        We argue that this choice limits the dynamicity, flexibility and reliability that a software based network could provide.

                    <p class="publications continue">
                        In this project, we focus on one of the problems of network management &mdash; service chaining &mdash; the steering of flows through the different network functions needed, before it is delivered to the destination.
                        We propose Function-Centric Service Chaining (FCSC), a novel approach that decouples the functions a flow needs from the location of network function instances (and thus routing) via a naming layer.
                        Such a decoupling facilitates the dynamic modification of the functions needed by a flow on the controller or the middleboxes (e.g., DPI, load balancer).
                        This also enables switches to dynamically detect the load (popularity) of a certain function and accordingly instantiate/dispose of network function instances (co-resident with the switch or on some other node).
                        The enroute function-based routing allows more dynamic use of the newly created instances and faster recovery from node/link failures.
                        FCSC intrinsically supports the presence of multiple instances for the same functionality and can perform network-layer load-balancing among these nodes at any time.
                        By placing the flow state in the packet header, FCSC helps to reduce the amount of state stored in the network and results in much better scalability compared to the per-flow state solutions like SDN.
                        FCSC is therefore able to provide a highly dynamic and adaptive Service Chaining capability and effectively exploit the promise of NFV in the software-based network of the future.

                        We use a real-world topology to compare the performance of FCSC and a more &quot;traditional&quot; SDN solution.
                        We show that FCSC reacts to failures with fewer packet drops, adapts to new middleboxes more quickly, and maintains less state in the network.

                <div id="copss-description">
                    <p class="publications continue">
                        Content-Centric Networks (CCN) provide substantial flexibility for users to obtain information without regard to the source of the information or its current location.
                        Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems have gained popularity in society to provide the convenience of removing the temporal dependency of the user having to indicate an interest each time he or she wants to receive a particular piece of related information.
                        Currently, on the Internet, such pub/sub systems have been built on top of an IP-based network with the additional responsibility placed on the end-systems and servers to do the work of getting a piece of information to interested recipients.
                        We propose Content-Oriented Pub/Sub System (COPSS) to achieve an efficient pub/sub capability for CCN.
                        COPSS enhances the heretofore inherently pull-based CCN architectures proposed by integrating a push based multicast capability at the content-centric layer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="publications continue2">The architecture also includes the following components:</p>
                    <ul class="publications continue">
                        <li>A gaming application taking advantage of the efficient multicast (G-COPSS).</li>
                        <li>A notification application for efficient communication in disasters (CNS).</li>
                        <li>A congestion control protocol for efficient and network-friendly multicast (SAID).</li>
                        <li>An object-resolution service that maps different features (e.g., keywords, audio clips) to names (ORICE).</li>
                        <li>A routing algorithm for efficient request forwarding with concept of &quot;virtual domains&quot; (VDR).</li>
                        <li>A mechanism allowing ICNs to coexist with each other and IP (COEXIST, COIN). </li>
